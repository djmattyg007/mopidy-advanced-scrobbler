TODO: Move recording of plays out into separate package that can also provide a history of plays on a day-by-day basis
TODO: add filtering (and maybe sorting) capabilities to corrections table
TODO: add Last.fm track/artist/album links to web interface
TODO: update "submitted" display to be more comprehensive. requires backend changes to allow marking a play as ignored rather than just deleting. change submitted column to a "status" column.
TODO: load loved tracks from last.fm in a playlist. reload tracks on a timer I guess?
TODO: fix bug where submitting individual tracks doesn't reduce the unscrobbled count in the table header
